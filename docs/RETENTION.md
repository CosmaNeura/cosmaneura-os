# Retention behavior (L0)

- Insurance working copies (`Artifact` front/back) are deleted **7 days after**
  ticket `closed_at`, driven by an injectable clock in tests/demo.
- Purge writes a receipt with: opaque `artifact_id`, retention rule, deletion
  time, outcome. No patient label, blob path, or content hash of deleted bytes.
- Audit events record `artifact.purged` without payload bytes.
- Ordinary API/telemetry responses do not include blob paths or signed URLs.
